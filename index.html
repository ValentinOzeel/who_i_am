                            Throughout my doctoral studies, I grew from a novice to a <h6>self-reliant</h6> scientist. I <h7>unexpectedly</h7> found myself in a position where I had to assume <h7>full responsibility</h7> for <h7>all aspects</h7> of my project, from conception to manuscript preparation, while navigating the disruptions caused by the pandemic.
                            <br><br>My doctoral research produced <h6>valuable insights</h6> into <h7>potential therapeutic targets resistant to escape mutations</h7> in influenza viruses and garnered <h6>praise</h6> from experts in structural biology, bioinformatics, and virology. 
                            <br><br>However, despite achieving <h6>significant results</h6> and preparing manuscripts for publication, circumstances <h7>beyond my control</h7> hindered their submission. 
                            <br><br>Overall, it demonstrated my <h7>independence</h7>, <h7>resilience</h7>, <h7>adaptability</h7>, and ability to <h6>design and execute innovative multidisciplinary research</h6> independently, despite <h7>extremely challenging</h7> circumstances.
                            <br><br>It is still <h7>challenging</h7> for me to discuss the details of my PhD experience. However, while I <h7>refrain from discussing specific hardships</h7>, avoiding <h7>negative</h7> reflections that <h7>wouldn't be professional</h7>, my PhD was a <h6>quantum leap</h6> that catalyzed my personal and professional growth.

                                <br><b>Influenza A viruses (IAVs)</b> cause yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics that represent a <b>global health threat</b> of major concern. Virus entry within cells is carried out by the <b>hemagglutinin (HA)</b>, a trimeric surface glycoprotein of which each protomer is constituted of two sub-units (HA1, HA2). The HA <b>binds its receptor</b> at the cell surface and induces the <b>endocytosis</b> of the particle. The exposure of the HA to <b>acidic pH</b> upon maturation of the endosome triggers a <b>drastic conformational change (CC)</b>, which enables the <b>fusion between endosomal and viral membranes</b>. 
                                <br><br>The HA is intrinsically <b>extremely variable</b>, it has been classified in subtypes, clades and groups. Based on 269 trimeric prefusion structures, we computed <b>six interaction types</b>, including <b>electrostatic interactions</b> (which are sensitive to pH variations), along with their distribution intra- and inter-protomer (ITA-p/ITR-p) and intra- and inter-sub-unit. We revealed <b>distinct clade-dependent physicochemical profiles</b> of interaction networks. These different profiles of networks enable the folding of highly similar trimeric metastable structures carrying identical function and thus suggested that <b>HA evolution is constrained</b> accordingly, and that the function may be carried out by <b>different CC molecular drivers</b>. 
                                <br><br>We then computed the <b>conserved interactions</b> across HA classifications. We characterized a <b>buried complex consisting of two connected ITR-p salt-bridges</b>, located at a crucial area for the CC. The first is the ITR-p HA2-HA2 (E742-R762) salt-bridge, strictly conserved among all HAs except clade 7 HAs and H17. The second is the ITR-p HA1-HA2 (E1041-R762) salt-bridge, conserved among almost every subtype of group 1 HAs, whereas the ITR-p HA2-HA2 (R762-E812) salt-bridge is strictly conserved among clade 3 HAs. The <b>functional importance</b> of the complex was analyzed through <b>mutagenesis, fusion assays and reverse genetics</b> (+ western blot, cleavage assays, flow cytometry and viral kinetics) in two viruses from clade 1 (H1) and 3 (H3), which displayed distinct physicochemical profiles. Mutations were <b>tolerated in the H3 context</b>, in vitro, whereas in the <b>H1 context any mutation disrupting the complex resulted in a loss of fusogenic function and unviable mutant viruses</b>. The results therefore indicated that HA evolution is constrained according to the underlying physicochemical profile of interaction networks. The strict conservation of the complex in structures sharing the H1 physicochemical profile and several other factors, that include the identical geometric arrangement of the complex in space, suggested that the <b>essential nature of the complex in H1 is likely to be extrapolated to other HAs sharing the same physicochemical profile</b>. 
                                <br><br>Finally, we tracked the <b>modulation of interactions during the CC</b> based of structures of fusion intermediates (H3). We revealed various molecular drivers, especially the <b>disruption of highly conserved ITR-p HA2-HA2 salt-bridges</b> located at the membrane-proximal domain, which might be key in the context of the clade 3 physicochemical profile. 
                                <br><br>Overall, assessments of the functional importance of the conserved ITR-p salt-bridges complex in different environments highlighted that <b>underlying clade-dependent physicochemical profile of interaction networks influences CC molecular drivers and how function is performed</b>. These profiles influence the <b>mutational tolerance</b> of specific residues and thereby <b>limit HA evolution</b>. Our results demonstrated that <b>comprehensive analysis of interaction networks</b> in the context of HA variability enables to better understand its evolution as well as to take advantage of the variability to identify <b>crucial conserved interactions</b>. Most importantly, we highlighted the value of combining <b>interaction conservation assessments and functional validation</b> to provide insightful data for the research of <b>broad and non-escapable therapeutic targets and vaccine epitopes</b>.
